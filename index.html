        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>Hi my name is Qianyi Kuang I am studying at UCR, majoring in business economics. I am a junior this year. Also Iâ€™m transferring from Pasadena city college.I have a cheerful personality and enjoy communicating with others. During my college years, I developed my leadership and organizational skills by actively participating in club activities and taking on tasks. These are very important and very helpful possibilities for the future, but for many people this is also very difficult. I found it very difficult at first because my personality was relatively introverted at first, so taking the first step also requires courage. During my three years in college, I also made many friends, who gave me a lot of help and allowed me to learn a lot. This is another valuable asset besides professional knowledge during my college years. In short, I have learned a lot in four years of study and life, whether it is professional knowledge, social knowledge, or how to deal with people. It can be said that these three years have been the most meaningful period of my life. My life ideals and life pursuits were determined during this period. I had new plans for my career development, and I also had new goals in life.I usually like to read some knowledge about business.

I am very interested in this aspect because I want to work in this field in the future and can cooperate with others and I love to be social and make some great friends. At the same time, I can also study with them. I think this is my honor.. I also need to constantly improve myself. I have many advantages and disadvantages. I will correct these shortcomings in the future. I also have a wide range of interests and hobbies. I like listening to music and watching movies that can change some of my incorrect ideas. I can get some inspiration from them. There are also some sports. I like playing badminton and  I love hanging out with my friends .I think exercise can bring me a lot of benefits. Sometimes I am often in a state of anxiety, so I really need exercise to resolve my negative emotions

        </p>I love to laugh, love music, love simplicity, love liveliness, love listening to music, love making friends, love being free, also love funny, love quiet, but also love crazy lively, love myself, that's how I am , whether you appreciate it or not, I still stumble on my life path without losing my posture. be myself alaways! My history has no dazzling decoration, only the hardship and determination to prove myself step by step. Being a study committee member is not an idle job as imagined, but you must be responsible for everyone's study; only after receiving the "Three Good Students'' can you understand that success is not easy, but real and unremitting efforts; having won the "Three Good Students" "Excellent class leader" finally tasted the sweetness of "serving his position and pursuing his political goals''. Let it be the past, after all, it has become history. What I can do is to seize the opportunity in the new journey of college students, show myself, and share the surprises brought by the university with everyone. Entering college means endless opportunities, a chance to conquer new territory. I want to enrich my life in college, cultivate my abilities, and constantly improve myself. The stage is so big, I will work hard and struggle. I will not regret my journey in college.
